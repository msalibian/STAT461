# STAT461

### Setting up / running Jupyter notebooks

You have essentially two choices to use this notebook "live":
 
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install.html) to install Jupyter on your laptop. You will also need to follow [these instructions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r) to install the `R kernel` for Jupyter.

2. Or, run the notebooks on the [syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) server. There are Julia, Python 2, Python 3, and R kernels available (although we will only use the R one). Sign in with your UBC CWL. Once you are logged in, use [this link](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/msalibian/STAT461) to clone the GitHub repository (STAT461) where these notebooks are stored directly onto your [syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) home directory.
